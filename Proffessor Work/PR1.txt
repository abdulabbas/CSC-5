Project 1 07/21/15
Your project needs to be a minimum of 100 lines.  
The minimum requirements will only meet a C grade.  
It should implement one of your favorite games with sufficient logic to be worthy of a programming project.
It must illustrate all the concepts we have covered, specifically the 7 constructs, primitive data types, formating, file i/o, etc...
It must also include a writeup. 
See the attached examples.  
Naturally, develop in your repository.  
Place the Project 1 folder inside your projects folder.  
Again, I want to see the progression of development.  
This is worth 20% of your grade, equivalent to all your homeworks, so make it look like you spent that kind of time.
As always, submit the result here, copy yourself on the email, attach the zipped solution folder and send to
