Note: Submit the Midterm to my RCC email account mark.lehr@rcc.edu
with the following subject:  LastName,FirstName - Midterm - Section #.

Submit the solutions/program in a zipped file.
Do the best you can and turn in as much as you can.  
Do not post to Github, just an email and in Blackboard.
You must do all work yourself, no help allowed.  You may
ask questions to clarify the problem.

Note:  I just want one program for the solution to all the problems 
that follow. The program should prompt the user for which problem 
solution to display. Use a do-while and switch construct somewhat
like the following for the display of the menu and the selection of
which problem to run.

	int inN;
        do{
         Menu();
         inN=getN();
         switch(inN){
          case 1:    problem1();break;
          case 2:    problem2();break;
          case 3:    problem3();break;
          case 4:    problem4();break;
          case 5:    problem5();break;
          case 6:    problem6();break;
          default:   def(inN);}
        }while(inN<7);

Note:  In addition, I included this menu program if you haven't already
looked at it.


1)  Input the number than make an X in the following way,
for instance, when you input a 5 you output

5   1
 4 2
  3
 4 2
5   1

when you input a 7 you output

7     1
 6   2
  5 3
   4
  5 3
 6   2
7     1


Use for-loops, and Flowchart this solution.
	


2)  Read a 4 character number.  Output the result in in the following
format, input = 9873
3 ***
7 *******
8 ********
9 *********

If one of the numbers is not a digit, then put a ? mark
input = 98a3
3 ***
a ?
8 ********
9 *********


3)  We would like to write a check.  Input the following:
Date, Payee, Amount, and the account holder.  Output these
in the following format, but the amount needs to be output
numerically as well as grammatically just like a check.
Range for the check amount = $1 to $999 (integers, no 
cents)

Input the following 4 values
Date:            01/01/15
Payee:           John Doe
Amount:          $811
Account Holder:  Jane Doe


Output a written check

Jane Doe
STREET ADDRESS
CITY, STATE  ZIP                            Date:  01/01/15

Pay to the Order of:  John Doe              $ 811.00

Eight Hundred Eleven and no/100s Dollars

BANK OF CSC5

FOR:  GOTTA PAY THE RENT	            Jane Doe	



4) An ISP has 3 different subscription packages
	a)  $16.85 per month, 5 hours access.  Additional hours
	    are $0.80 up to 20 hours then $1 for all additional
	    hours.
	b)  $23.85 per month, 15 hours access.  Additional hours
            are $0.65 up to 25 hours then $0.70 for each
	    hour above this limit.
	c)  $29.55 per month unlimited access
Write a program that calculates a customers monthly bill.  Ask which
package, and how many hours then display the monthly charge.  Also, output
when customers should transition to another package and what package that
should be to save the most money.  Calculate the money saved.



5)  Develop an application that will determine the gross pay for 
employees. The company pays "straight-time" for the 
first 20 hours worked, time and a half for all hours worked in 
excess of 20 hours but less than 40 hours, and double time for any 
hours worked over 40 hours. Inputs to the program would be hours
worked and rate of pay.  Output would be gross pay.



6)  Just another sequence, 

sum = n/x^0 + (n-1)/x^1 + (n-2)/x^2 + (n-3)/x^3 + ............

Input x and the number of terms=n, output the result.
Note:  x^1 = x,   x^2 = x*x,  x^3 = x*x*x

Flowchart and code this solution.
