Project 2 has 301 words in total.

The 2nd project will be a modified version of the 1st project. 

It may inclued artwork, and it might read the words from a file and pick a word at random.

It should cover any new or old concepts covered in the CSC5 class of this term.

The write up should be modified to suite this project.

Make a flow chart that can be more useful for any one to be able to understand the flow of this projects code.

Make sure that I have covered what is needed to make the project get a better grade.
